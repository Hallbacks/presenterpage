            Welcome to my visual journey, where a discerning eye for aesthetics
            converges with a dedication to process and thoughtfulness. <br />

            <p class="py-4">
              I am a dedicated design enthusiast and multimedia design student
              in my third semester at the Copenhagen School of Design and
              Technology (KEA), specializing in digital design. <br /><br />

              I am passionate about exploring various visual components and
              interactive methods to shape user experiences in the digital
              realm. My creativity is the driving force behind finding
              innovative solutions to any challenges. I am proactive, creative,
              and a strong team player, capable of fostering synergy across
              media platforms, as well as focusing on a single discipline when
              necessary. <br /><br />

              With experience and proficiency in software such as Figma, Adobe
              InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, Adobe XD, and
              various web technologies and frameworks like HTML5, CSS, Tailwind,
              Astro, Alpine, and JavaScript, I thrive on continuously evolving
              within digital design, user interfaces, and concept development. <br
              /><br />

              I am motivated by being part of a strong team where both
              independent work and teamwork are valued. My goal is always to
              actively participate in a community where we inspire eachother and
              achieve the best results together. Being part of a team where we
              support each other and contribute to each other's development
              holds significant importance to me.
