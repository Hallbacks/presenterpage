          For our second semester's exam project, we had the opportunity to work
          with Nicolai Lorenzen, a Copenhagen-based freelance photographer. My
          team and I worked on redesigning his website and enhancing his digital
          presence. Our main objective was to attract more private clients while
          preserving his unique style. We received excellent responses from both
          the client and our teachers.

          Azad Demir is a talented jewelry designer based in Copenhagen. Beyond
          his craftsmanship, Azad aims to challenge societal norms and biases
          regarding gender-specific jewelry. My team and I created his website
          featuring an extensive interview, as well as a promotional video that
          reflects Azad as a designer while presenting his professional
          portfolio and his jewelry.

          provided insights into professional collaboration and the importance
          of visual identity.

          sustainability, minimalist design, and accessibility. We designed the
          infographics and created a new identity for Digital Cleanup Day.
